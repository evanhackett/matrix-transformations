# Matrix Transformations
Simple animation of a cube being rotated in 3-dimensional space.

I took a Linear Algebra class and I wanted to apply some of the stuff I learned to computer graphics.

Code is trash, just hacked it up quickly to apply the math and see an animation. Math instructor was impressed though ðŸ˜Ž
